            <br>
            <p> Scholar Program (2017 - Present) For first-generation students, students of color, and low-income students,
                the educational system presents challenges. These students, despite being high achievers, remain underrepresented
                at top colleges in the US. As of 2017 I have been a part of the Schuler Program.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Global Glimpse Brave New Leaders Virtual Summer Academy (2020) Global Glimpse is all about facilitating
                meaningful connections between people from different backgrounds, even in the virtual world. Global Glimpse
                is a study abroad program based on both high school and college students. </p>
            <br>

                groups in higher education. Boston University is a student-centered advocacy organization, unlike First Gen Connect,
                an administrative project.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Alianza Latina (2021 - present) Alianza Latina is Boston University's largest Latinx student organization

                students to learn more about Latinx culture and identity, regardless of their own race or ethnicity.
